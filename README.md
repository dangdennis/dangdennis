You won't find much anything here except lots of random garbage code I play with. I try out languages and frameworks left and right, and have unfortunately come to the conclusion that there isn't a perfect language with a perfect ecosystem. Trade-offs must exist.

If there was a perfect language, it'd have:
1. Unified tooling and stdlib for networking and unix APIs, e.g. cargo, go, dotnet, lsp.
2. A type system between Haskell, Scala, and OCaml with fast compilation times and easy stdout printing of data.
3. Can build cross-platform binaries.
4. Some supervisor-actor + green threads library or runtime, i.e. no function coloring, e.g. BEAM, go, jvm virtual threads.

Nearly all my work is in private repos owned by employers. My truly garbage repos are also private.
