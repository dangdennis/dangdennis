You won't find much anything here except lots of random garbage code I play with. I try out languages and frameworks left and right, and have come to the conclusion that there isn't a perfect language with a perfect ecosystem. Trade-offs everywhere! 

If there was a perfect language, it'd have:
1. Easy tooling and std lib for the web and linux APIs, e.g. Rust, Go
2. Some type system b/t Haskell and OCaml with fast compilation times but I can print my values 
3. Can build cross-platform binaries
4. Some supervisor-actor concurrency model, e.g. BEAM languages

Nearly all my work is in private repos owned by employers. My truly garbage repos are also private.
